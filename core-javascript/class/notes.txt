-Classes are primarily syntactical sugar over js's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript

-We can declare a class in two ways:
  1. class declaration (class.js#02)
  2. class expression (class.js#17)

-Constructor can be declared only once
-Unlike function class can't be hoisted
-Code inside class runs in strict mode
-Calling the class without new keyword can cause an error (class.js#32)
-Static methods can be access only by parent class and can't be by child or instance (class.js#35)
-Class methods and Accessor properties can computed names, That means their name can be provided at runtime (class.js#54)
