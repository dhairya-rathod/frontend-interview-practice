-Sets are the javascript's unique collection of values of any type which includes `NaN` and undefined

-Set Methods
  1. add: Adds item to the set (set.js#08)
  2. has: Returns `true` if item is available in the set else `false` (set.js#09-10)
  3. clear: Removes all the items from the set (set.js#12)
  4. delete: remove given item from the set (set.js#11)

-WeakSet is same as Set except it only store objects.
  1. WeakSet does not have size and foreach
  2. WeakSet is not iterable
  3. add() method throws an error for non object value

-WeakSet cleans itself once the object is deleted or if there is no reference to the object (set.js#33)
